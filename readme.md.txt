# Canister Field Mathematics (CFM™) & Virtual Quantum Computer  
### Prior Art Repository — Public Timestamped Evidence

This repository contains the core documents describing the discovery, formulation, and conceptual design of:

- **Canister Field Mathematics (CFM™)**
- **Canister Field Processor (CFP)**
- **Virtual Quantum Computer (VQC) built on ICP**
- **Quantum-Inspired Computational Model derived from canister fields**
- **Early Czech and English drafts of the mathematical and computational framework**

The purpose of this repository is to provide **public, timestamped, and cryptographically provable prior art** ensuring that the concepts cannot be patented by third parties and remain open for beneficial use.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### **1. Canister Field Processor (CFP)**
- **`Canister Field Processor.odt`**  
  Foundational description of a processor model built not from transistors, but from *canisters* on the Internet Computer.  
  Contains:
  - computational graph architecture  
  - low-level mechanics  
  - mapping of classical operations to canister-field operations  
  - first technical formalization  

---

### **2. From Canister Fields to Quantum-Inspired Computation**
- **`From Canister Fields to Quantum-Inspired Co….odt`**  
  This document connects CFM with quantum-inspired computation.  
  Includes:
  - analogies to qubits, registers, Hamiltonians  
  - superposition-like behaviour emergent from parallel canister networks  
  - theoretical mapping to gate-level quantum operations  
  - motivation for Virtual Quantum Machine (VQM) on ICP

### **3. Virtual Quantum Computer (VQC)**
- **`Virtual Quantum Computer.odt`**  
  The main conceptual document describing how a **quantum-like computer** can be constructed entirely from ICP canisters.  
  Includes:
  - state evolution in CFM  
  - virtual Hamiltonian simulation  
  - register layout  
  - scaling rules  
  - comparison to classical HPC and quantum hardware

### **4. Czech Draft (Historical Version)**
- **`Virtuální kvantový počítač.odt`**  
  Early Czech-language formulation of the same ideas, useful as supporting prior art and documentation of the development timeline.

## ⚖️ Licensing & Intended Usage

The author intends:

- To **publish CFM™ and VQC models as prior art**, preventing restrictive third-party patents.  
- To permit **open use**, experimentation, and research.  
- To optionally require that **20% of profit generated by computations** using this model is donated to the **nearest church/charity** at the location where the computation was performed.  
- Commercial users should provide attribution and respect this intended ethical framework.

Formal legal license may be added later.
