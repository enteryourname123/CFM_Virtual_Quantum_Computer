## ⚖️ Licensing & Intended Usage

The author intends:

- To **publish CFM™ and VQC models as prior art**, preventing restrictive third-party patents.  
- To permit **open use**, experimentation, and research.  
- To optionally require that **20% of profit generated by computations** using this model is donated to the **nearest church/charity** at the location where the computation was performed.  
- Commercial users should provide attribution and respect this intended ethical framework.

Formal legal license may be added later.
